Why do you need the symlinks?

I don't. There should be different Pictures instead.
Some represent different states of the same Building:
eg: market-empty, market-low, market-med, market-full 
Other are several kinds of similar elemnts, like
railud, railudr, railludr... etc. which show rails
in different directions. Some of the images are used
to do animations.

The iso-Rendere expects the same imagenames as the original game.
Names are defined in "lincity/lctypes.h".

See http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/lincity/ for 
Overview of original Pictures
