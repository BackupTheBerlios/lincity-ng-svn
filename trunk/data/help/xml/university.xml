	<p style="hp">Universities help to increase your technology level. In the process they consume goods and jobs. They produce more than schools for a given goods/jobs input. However, they use a lot of these and also cost quite a lot of money to run, so you should have the economic and industrial capacity to supply them.</p>
	<p style="hp">You will need a number of universities to achieve a tech level close to 100%</p>
	<p style="hp">Universities do not need to be connected to transport; they can get all thier requirements from markets (which must be in range and have goods and jobs available).</p>

	<p style="hsubtitle">NOTE</p>
	<p style="hp">You <b>must</b> have 5 schools PER university to supply it with students.</p>
