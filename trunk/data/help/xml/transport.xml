	<p style="hp">There are three types of transport in lin-city, tracks, roads and railways. There is a fourth form that consists of 'hopping across a field'. This is a short range form of trading and will not be referred to as transport again. However, it is very important and will be dealt with before tracks, roads and railways.</p>
	<p style="hp">People can obtain food, goods and employment from markets that are within walking distance of their residential area. See below for an example of the distances involved. Be conservative until you have got the feel of it.</p>
