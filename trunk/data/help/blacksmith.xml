	<p style="hp">Blacksmiths turn steel and coal into goods. You will use them mostly early on in the game. They also use jobs, of course.</p>
	<p style="hp">Before you have steel works, you must rely on the steel produced by communes. 5 or 6 per blacksmith is recommended.</p>
	<p style="hp">Blacksmiths do not have to be connected to transport. They can get all they need from markets that are within range.</p>
	<p style="hp">You can see when a blacksmith is working in the usual way, by clicking on it, and every so often the animation will come to life.</p>
