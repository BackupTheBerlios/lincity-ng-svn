	<p style="hp">Windmills provide power for residences and farms. They enable the farmer to process food more eficiently and make residences more desirable.</p>
	<p style="hp">Providing power to residences makes the people there use more goods.</p>
	<p style="hp">Low tech windmills do <b>not</b> provide power to industries. (Heavy industry can get power from coal, light industry needs <i>real</i> electricity to be <i>powered</i>, they still work without power at a lower output.)</p>
	<p style="hp">There are two forms of windmills.</p>

	<p style="hp">The type you get depends on your tech-level when you build it.</p>
