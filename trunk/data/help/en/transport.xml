	<p style="htitle">Transport</p>
	<p style="hp">There are three types of transport in lin-city, tracks, roads and railways. There is a fourth form that consists of 'hopping across a field'. This is a very short range form of trading and will not be referred to as transport again. However, it is very important and will be dealt with before tracks, roads and railways.</p>
	<p style="hp">People can obtain food, goods and employment from markets that are within walking distance of their residential area.</p>
	<p style="hp">All areas that require jobs (employees) get them from markets. (For example a steel works will get its employees from a local market.) They can also get them from passing transport.</p>
	<p style="hp">Farms can sell their food directly to markets, they do not have to deal with transport at all.</p>
	<p style="hp">Mills, Potteries and blacksmiths sell goods directly to nearby markets, they also get their raw materials from the same markets.</p>
	<p style="hp">The following areas deal with transport and markets. It's up to you what you use, - markets hold more <i>stock</i> than transport.</p>
	<p style="hp">Tracks, roads and railways are used to carry food, jobs, goods, coal, ore and steel between areas.</p>
	<p style="hp">Light industries, ore mines, tips, ports, coal mines, heavy industries and recycling centers connect to transport at the top left hand edge.</p>
	<p style="hp">An exception is the coal power station. For example take a coal fired power station connected to a coalmine with a road. A railway is coming out of the top gate of the coalmine and going off to the right.</p>
	<p style="hp">To cross a river with transport, simply bulldoze the river away and build a road, or whatever, through the gap.</p>
	<p style="hp">(With a little imagination), think of this as building a bridge. It costs you enough as bulldozing water is very expensive.</p>
