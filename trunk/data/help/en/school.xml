	<p style="hp">Schools use jobs and goods to produce technology in a similar way to universities. They use many less jobs and goods than universities, but produce far fewer tech points. Given the choice of putting 4 or five schools in a given area, or a university, it is often (but not always) better to put a university in.</p>
	<p style="hp">Schools do <b>not</b> need to connect to transport, but do need to be within range of a market than can supply the quantity of jobs and goods to make the school work.</p>
	<p style="hp">Schools cost money to run. You can see the total cost for the <b>last</b> year by clicking on the money button. The value 'scl' is the school cost.</p>
	<p style="hp">You can see when a blacksmith is working in the usual way, by clicking on it, and every so often the animation will come to life.</p>
