[H] High priority (important for first release)
[M] Medium priority (should be in the final game)
[L] Low priority (nice to have)
[?] I am not sure.

Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~

--Scons/Deployment--
 [M] compile some test apps to make sure SDL, SDL_mixer and SDL_image really
     work. Also test for their versions
 [M] Add install targets
 
 MatzeB: Alternatively I could use the jam scripts I already used in netpanzer
 and supertux. I should be able to get them running in an hour or so, which
 would be less work than fixing scons.

--Gui--
 [L] Cache fonts in FontManager
 [L] Share loaded images?
 [M] Implement dirty rectangle methods to only redraw when needed
 [?] Think about mechanism for attach arbitrary properties to components
    (for tooltips, styles (and layout data?) )
 [H] Links in helptext.
 [M] Images in helptext.
 [L] drawToTexture in OpenGL (noone using this at the moment, could be used to
     optimize minimap in the future)
 [M] Add tooltips for buttonpanel
 [L] Add maximize for Windows (see Window.cpp 74 ff)
      - really?

--Bugs--
 [M] mills.png shows a windmill but is used as button to build a mill.
     Should be more like a factory. 
 [H] New text on buttons is truncated to original textlength. 
     (eg in load game menu)
 [H] Check tech-requirements for buildings.
 [H] don't show Coal Reserve on Minimap until survey is done
 [M] also show area-information from right-click in oldgui

--Game--
 [M] some more sounds
 [M] "Loading..." screen (startup, run game)
        - is this really needed now that images and sounds get loaded in the
        background by a thread?
 [L] Use progress bar images provided in data/mainmenu/progressbar
     for "Loading..." menu 
 [M] Statisitcs dialog
 [M] Statistics graph
 [H] Dialogs for buildings (Harbour, Rocket)
 [H] Implement Dialogs (y/n)
 [M] Translate Dialogs (hardcoded stuff im old engine)
        - this can probably be avoided by the new dialog aproach where we define
        an xml file for each new dialog
 [H] Help System.
 [M] Display current money, current year, InfoMessages
 [M] Options-dialog
 [L] manpage, documentation
 [H] improve fast scrolling
 [H] Homepage http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/ 
 [H] Tile graphics
