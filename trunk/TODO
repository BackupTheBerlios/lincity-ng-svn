[H] High priority (important for first release)
[M] Medium priority (should be in the final game)
[L] Low priority (nice to have)
[?] I am not sure.

Graphics
~~~~~~~~

[H] Look around for a ttf font that can be distributed in a GPL game.
    (Warning: The currently used sans.ttf is from the bitstream vera fonts
     package which is not 100% compatible with GPL)
[H] Finish tiles for the game

Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~

--Gui--
 [L] Cache fonts in FontManager
 [L] Share loaded images?
 [M] Implement dirty rectangle methods to only redraw when needed
 [?] Think about mechanism for attach arbitrary properties to components
    (for tooltips, styles (and layout data?) )
 [H] Links in helptext.
 [M] Images in helptext.
 [L] drawToTexture in OpenGL (noone using this at the moment, could be used to
     optimize minimap in the future)
 [H] Add tooltips for buttonpanel
 [?] Usability testing log. That the buttons the user pressed (and additional
     actions like scrolling the map, creating buildings, displaying building
     stats). This could be used to measure common user actions and improve
     usability.
 [H] Implement tabbed component
 [H] Add possibility to filter image to turn grey for disabled checkbuttons

--Bugs--
 [M] mills.png shows a windmill but is used as button to build a mill.
     Should be more like a factory. 
 [H] New text on buttons is truncated to original textlength. 
     (eg in load game menu)
 [M] windmill starts "bouncing" up and down after you zoomed out
 [H] autoscrolling causes a segfault when resizing the window (GameView.cpp:668,
         because surface is NULL when resizing, so a simple if(surface) should
         work)
 
--Game--
 [M] some more sounds
 [M] "Loading..." screen (startup, run game)
        - is this really needed now that images and sounds get loaded in the
        background by a thread?
 [L] Use progress bar images provided in data/mainmenu/progressbar
     for "Loading..." menu 
 [M] Statisitcs dialog
 [M] Statistics graph
 [H] Help System.
 [M] Display InfoMessages
 [L] manpage, documentation
 [H] improve fast scrolling
 [M] Homepage http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/ 
 [H] Tile graphics
 [M] remove MPS_ENV, make MPS_MAP a popup 
 [M] put MPS_GLOBAL to tabs behind minimap
