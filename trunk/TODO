BUGS and MISFEATURES -- CRITICAL FOR FINAL VERSION

  o Need to compress and expand translation files and add installation hooks
    so that only desired translations get installed.
    *  I think we can just delete the translated version for 1.12, so the 
       above will not be necessary.
	** Fixed in pre50?

  o I found inconsistent behavior with using the middle mouse button
    (mmb).  Clicking with mmb on mini-map causes the main win to jump, and
    then jump back before scrolling.  Clicking mmb on other displays (finance
    or unemployment graph) advances the display.  Probably only lmb should
    advance display.  Also, I'm not sure if mmb should initiate main win
    scrolling if the click was made outside the main win.

  o There still seems to be a problem with putting multi-transport off 
    the bottom of the screen.  For example, resources can wrap-around 
	from bottom to top.

  o Help gets screwed up by game-related keystrokes.
    Consider also pressing "Enter" when mouse is over a button on the 
    opening screen.

  o Population pbar is wrong when starting new game, since game starts 
    with different number of people for random villiage and blank screen 
    this is difficult to fix.
	*  Fixed by Corey?

  o Money is not updated while paused.
	*  Fixed by Corey?

  o Bits of the square cursor are not refreshed from the main win frame.
    For example, this happens with pollution overlay turned on.

  o Location that money is displayed in lower status area is not 
    updated on a resize.

  o Frame of main win is displayed before load game progress bar finishes.

  o Some missing keystrokes on windows (which ones?)

  o Options screen should have a keystroke (perhaps "o" for options, 
    "v" for overlay).

  o Tech buttons are not disabled properly when loading a game with 
    lower tech level from game with higher tech level.

	To reproduce:  load a decent game (or hit 't' a bunch) and then start
	a new game.  All techs that were available still are, only now your
	brand new solar station has a tech of 0.0%.
	Only happens on a new game, not on loading existing game.

  o Intermittent mouse bug with multitransport.  The following phenomena
    can occur:

	-  Stays in MT mode after mouse release
	-  MT drawn over existing track causes track to disappear

  o Money format in finance window is ugly


BUGS and MISFEATURES and MISSING FEATURES -- NON-CRITICAL

  o Right click outside of help should exit help.

  o Re-remove c++ style comments.

  o Since cvs doesn't store timestamps, need to manually set timestamps 
    to build from cvs.  For now, workaround using fix-timestamps.sh.

  o When you bulldoze water or create water, you're warned that it is
    very expensive.  However, you only get this warning once, so that it's
    easy to bulldoze multiple times.  However, when you bulldoze shanties you
    get the message every time.  This is inconvenient.
	*  Fixed by Corey?

  o Main screen should scroll when moving mouse outside of main window 
    during multi-transport.

  o First time for placing residence flashes help then choice screen.
    Fix by allowing choice in help screen???

  o Finish i18n.

  o Miniscreen colors could be improved.

  o xpicedit doesn't seem to work on 24 bit color machines.

  o When a tip burns up, there is no pollution at all, and the tip disappears.
    Tip should stay, should cause pollution(?).

  o Technology indicator sometimes shows both a rise and fall.  This happens
    after loading a game, old indicator remains as a ghost.
	*  Fixed by Corey?

  o There is a display bug, where a small block is left when
    exiting a help page. The only happens when part of the mouse cursor is in
    the main window during the re-draw. It quicky disappears when the main
    window is scrolled or updated.

    I've seen this display bug also happens when refreshing after 
    modal dialog boxes.

  o Need to support -display and other XWindows command line option.

  o Need to clean up write of gzipped files to use popen().

  o Why don't we use a recognized file format for the splash screen?

  o Need to update dependencies in Makefile.am so that "cp" warnings go away.

  o Slight streaking in monthgraph.

  o Like to have info pages and/or printed documentation.

  o Animations for paths/roads/railroads.

  o Power stations list a "cycle" percentage, which under previous versions 
    cycled around (presumably one quanta of power is released at the end of 
    each cycle?).  However, in the CVS code the listed cycle never changes.
	Display bug:  cycle is equal to capacity.
