--Scons/Deployment--
 * compile some test apps to make sure SDL, SDL_mixer and SDL_image really work.
   Also test for their versions
 * redo configuration phase if the SConstruct file changed...
 * Add install targets

--Gui--
 * Cache fonts in FontManager
 * Cache loaded images?
 * Implement dirty rectangle methods to only redraw when needed
 * Think about mechanism for attach arbitrary properties to components
    (for tooltips, styles (and layout data?) )
