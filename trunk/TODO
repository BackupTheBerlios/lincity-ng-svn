[H] High priority (important for first release)
[M] Medium priority (should be in the final game)
[L] Low priority (nice to have)
[?] I am not sure.

Graphics (mostly egore's part)
~~~~~~~~

[H] Finish tiles for the game
[H] Draw Mousecursors for normal, link and what's this (eventually also
    loading and scrolling)
[H] We need an icon (48x48 png with alpha for kde/gnome, eventually 128x128 png
        alpha for mac os/x and 32x32 keycolored (and/or alpha) for windows)
[H] give all ingames dialogs the same look and feel. (not like win32 is possible)
[H] rework resident icons

Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~

--Gui--
 [L] Cache fonts in FontManager
 [L] Share loaded images?
 [M] Implement dirty rectangle methods to only redraw when needed
 [?] Think about mechanism for attach arbitrary properties to components
    (for tooltips, styles (and layout data?) )
 [M] Add back/forward buttons to help window
 [M] drawToTexture in OpenGL (noone using this at the moment, could be used to
     optimize minimap in the future. Maybe this is a good starting point :
     http://www.paulsprojects.net/opengl/rtotex/rtotex.html)
     glTexSubImage2D might be helpfull
 [?] Usability testing log. That the buttons the user pressed (and additional
     actions like scrolling the map, creating buildings, displaying building
     stats). This could be used to measure common user actions and improve
     usability.
 [H] Add possibility to filter image to turn grey for disabled checkbuttons

--Bugs--
 [M] mills.png shows a windmill but is used as button to build a mill.
     Should be more like a factory. (egore)
 [H] New text on buttons is truncated to original textlength. 
     (eg in load game menu)
 [M] windmill starts "bouncing" up and down after you zoomed out
      -Wrong values in images/tiles/images.xml- (modern windmill) 
      -Scaling in SDL-Mode- (historic windmill)
      WolfgangB: The problem is the scaling method. If all windmill?w.png
      have the same height there is no bouncing. That means some aditional
      blank lines, But until we find out what is wrong with the scaling 
      its the only solution i can think of.
 [H] scrolling slowly in SDL mode makes all houses bigger than 1x1 cells bounce
     around.

--Game--
 [H] Write tooltips texts for all in-game button
 [H] Implement a What's this button
 [M] some more sounds
 [L] "Loading..." screen (startup, run game)
        - is this really needed now that images and sounds get loaded in the
        background by a thread?
 [L] Use progress bar images provided in data/mainmenu/progressbar
     for "Loading..." menu 
 [M] Statistics graph
 [M] Display InfoMessages
 [L] manpage, documentation
 [H] improve fast scrolling
 [M] Homepage http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/ 
 [H] The settings dialog still doesn't look that good 
 [H] Put scrolling on the right mouse button. Moving the mouse while holding
     middle button isn't as ergonomically as moving with right button pressed
     on most mice.
     (This extra info that is know on the second mouse button can either be put
      on the middle button or simply removed. After all it just states stuff
      that you can see with the minimap/overlays or statustext too)
     [info is not that detailed in overlays]
 [M] Print out more debug infos that user can send in with debug reports:
		architecture?, SDL version, opengl driver name, SDL software driver name,
		SDL sound driver name, screen resolution
