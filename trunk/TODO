[H] High priority (important for first release)
[M] Medium priority (should be in the final game)
[L] Low priority (nice to have)
[?] I am not sure.

Graphics (mostly egore's part)
~~~~~~~~

 [H] Finish tiles for the game
 [M] Draw Mousecursors for normal, link and what's this (eventually also
     loading and scrolling)
 [M] We need an icon (48x48 png with alpha for kde/gnome, eventually 128x128 png
        alpha for mac os/x and 32x32 keycolored (and/or alpha) for windows)
 [M] Review/Improve Look and Feel of the ingame dialogs
 [L] rework resident icons - is this really needed?

Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~

--Gui--
 [M] Implement dirty rectangle methods to only redraw when needed
 [?] Think about mechanism for attach arbitrary properties to components
    (for tooltips, styles (and layout data?) )
 [M] Add back/forward buttons to help window
 [M] drawToTexture in OpenGL (noone using this at the moment, could be used to
     optimize minimap in the future. Maybe this is a good starting point :
     http://www.paulsprojects.net/opengl/rtotex/rtotex.html)
     glTexSubImage2D might be helpfull
 [?] Usability testing log. That the buttons the user pressed (and additional
     actions like scrolling the map, creating buildings, displaying building
     stats). This could be used to measure common user actions and improve
     usability.

--Bugs--
 [L] New text on buttons is truncated to original textlength. 
     (eg in load game menu)
 [M] Teleporation power (removing power lines still allows that power is
     running where they were before)
     [Sure? Does it take longer than in classic until the effect is 
     visible?] 
 [M] Game does not handle Expose Events
     (switch desktop and return to the credits-screen, then it is whole black.)   
 [M] there is no way other way to change resolution than editing the config file
  [M] add commandline switch
  [L] add switch in preferences

--Game--
 [M] Check for missing tooltip texts for in-game buttons.
 [M] Implement a What's this button - down to [M], we can simply open the front
     page of the help file for now...
 [L] manpage, documentation
 [M] Print out more debug infos that user can send in with debug reports:
     architecture?, SDL version, opengl driver name, SDL software driver name,
     SDL sound driver name, screen resolution
 [H] make buttonbar pop up on left mouse button!
     [WolfgangB: I don't think thats a good idea. I often switch between
     two things already on rootbuttons.]

-- Infrastructure/Deployment --
 [H] Create a source package and test if it compiles and installs correctly
 [H] Setup an automatic backup script for the wiki!
 [H] Create a (real) Homepage. Needs a little description what lincity-ng is
     about, who created it, where to download it, how to install (and play?)
     it, list of some screenshots, contact information for thank yous and
     bugreports.
     Actually we might just redesign the wiki for that...
 [M] Create a bugs page in the wiki with explanations on how a good bug reports
     looks like and how to fill new bugs into the wiki.
 [H] Compile a win32 version and create an installer for it
 [H] Create a compiled (x86) linux version that installs and runs out of the box
     (www.autopackage.org?)
 [H] Have some beta testing of the packages. (Someone has a ppc/mac?)
 [M] Create packages or find people who will do that. (Gentoo, Debian, Rpms,
     ...). This will probably happen by itself, so there's no need to push too
     much ourself. But we should listen to packagers and fix problems if they
     have some (instead of letting each distro patch stuff themselfes).
 [L] Is it possible to automatically generate/maintain a ChangeLog file from svn
     commits?
