BUGS and MISFEATURES -- CRITICAL FOR FINAL VERSION

  o I found inconsistent behavior with using the middle mouse button
    (mmb).  Clicking with mmb on mini-map causes the main win to jump, and
    then jump back before scrolling.  Clicking mmb on other displays (finance
    or unemployment graph) advances the display.  Probably only lmb should
    advance display.  Also, I'm not sure if mmb should initiate main win
    scrolling if the click was made outside the main win.

  o SVGALIB version only partly resets selection to 'track' on load game.
    To reproduce, select a large item (e.g. farm), then load a game.

BUGS and MISFEATURES and MISSING FEATURES -- NON-CRITICAL

  o High resolution SVGA version the mouse responsiveness to multi-
    transport is poor.

  o No middle mouse button support in SVGA version.

  o Bits of the square cursor are not refreshed from the main win frame.
    For example, this happens with pollution overlay turned on.
    This problem is more pronouced in SVGA version.

  o I fixed problem with the windows version where it draws a square
	cursor over the load/save screens.  This was caused because 
	the windows version wasn't setting db_flag before calling 
	GetKeystroke() which called cs_mouse_handler().

  o Help gets screwed up by game-related keystrokes.
    Consider also pressing "Enter" when mouse is over a button on the 
    opening screen.

  o Population pbar is wrong when starting new game, since game starts 
    with different number of people for random villiage and blank screen 
    this is difficult to fix.  GCS: I verified that this still exists, 
	Apr 5, 2003.

  o There still seems to be a problem with putting multi-transport off 
    the bottom of the screen.  For example, resources can wrap-around 
    from bottom to top.

    To reproduce, put a horizontal bit of track across the top row.
    Then, drag track from the city down off past the edge of the main 
    screen (you might need to do this a few times).  Now check the 
    track on the top, and you will see goods, jobs, etc flowing off 
    the bottom into the top.

    (GCS July 26, 2003) cannot reproduce in svga version.

  o Right click outside of help should exit help.

  o Re-remove c++ style comments.

  o Since cvs doesn't store timestamps, need to manually set timestamps 
    to build from cvs.  For now, workaround using fix-timestamps.sh.

  o Main screen should scroll when moving mouse outside of main window 
    during multi-transport.

  o First time for placing residence flashes help then choice screen.
    Fix by allowing choice in help screen???

  o Miniscreen colors could be improved.

  o xpicedit doesn't seem to work on 24 bit color machines.

  o When a tip burns up, there is no pollution at all, and the tip disappears.
    Tip should stay, should cause pollution(?).

  o Technology indicator sometimes shows both a rise and fall.  This happens
    after loading a game, old indicator remains as a ghost.
	*  Fixed by Corey?

  o There is a display bug, where a small block is left when
    exiting a help page. The only happens when part of the mouse cursor is in
    the main window during the re-draw. It quicky disappears when the main
    window is scrolled or updated.

    I've seen this display bug also happens when refreshing after 
    modal dialog boxes.

  o Need to support -display and other XWindows command line option.

  o Need to clean up write of gzipped files to use popen().

  o Why don't we use a recognized file format for the splash screen?

  o Need to update dependencies in Makefile.am so that "cp" warnings go away.

  o Slight streaking in monthgraph.

  o Like to have info pages and/or printed documentation.

  o Animations for paths/roads/railroads.

  o Power stations list a "cycle" percentage, which under previous versions 
    cycled around (presumably one quanta of power is released at the end of 
    each cycle?).  However, in the CVS code the listed cycle never changes.
    Display bug:  cycle is equal to capacity.
