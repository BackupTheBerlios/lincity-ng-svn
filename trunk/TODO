[H] High priority (important for first release)
[M] Medium priority (should be in the final game)
[L] Low priority (nice to have)
[?] I am not sure.

Graphics
~~~~~~~~

[H] Finish tiles for the game
[H] Draw Mousecursors for normal, link and what's this (eventually also
    loading)

Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~

--Gui--
 [L] Cache fonts in FontManager
 [L] Share loaded images?
 [M] Implement dirty rectangle methods to only redraw when needed
 [?] Think about mechanism for attach arbitrary properties to components
    (for tooltips, styles (and layout data?) )
 [M] Add back/forward buttons to help window
 [M] drawToTexture in OpenGL (noone using this at the moment, could be used to
     optimize minimap in the future. Maybe this is a good starting point :
     http://www.paulsprojects.net/opengl/rtotex/rtotex.html)
 [H] Add tooltips for buttonpanel
 [?] Usability testing log. That the buttons the user pressed (and additional
     actions like scrolling the map, creating buildings, displaying building
     stats). This could be used to measure common user actions and improve
     usability.
 [H] Implement tabbed component (MatzeB)
 [H] Add possibility to filter image to turn grey for disabled checkbuttons

--Bugs--
 [M] mills.png shows a windmill but is used as button to build a mill.
     Should be more like a factory. (egore)
 [H] New text on buttons is truncated to original textlength. 
     (eg in load game menu)
 [M] windmill starts "bouncing" up and down after you zoomed out
      -Wrong values in images/tiles/images.xml- (modern windmill) 
      -Scaling in SDL-Mode- (historic windmill)
      WolfgangB: The problem is the scaling method. If all windmill?w.png
      have the same height there is no bouncing. That means some aditional
      blank lines, But until we find out what is wrong with the scaling 
      its the only solution i can think of.

--Game--
 [H] Implement a What's this button
 [M] some more sounds
 [L] "Loading..." screen (startup, run game)
        - is this really needed now that images and sounds get loaded in the
        background by a thread?
 [L] Use progress bar images provided in data/mainmenu/progressbar
     for "Loading..." menu 
 [M] Statisitcs dialog
 [M] Statistics graph
 [M] Display InfoMessages
 [L] manpage, documentation
 [H] improve fast scrolling
 [M] Homepage http://lincity-ng.berlios.de/ 
 [M] remove MPS_ENV, make MPS_MAP a popup 
 [M] put MPS_GLOBAL to tabs behind minimap
