* regression from 1.0.3 (dont know precisely when)
  When tech is not high enough, trying to build a grayed item, just close the item tray,
  and show a message in the console only.
  1.0.3 behavior is to let the  item tray open, so info_bubble pop-up and shows the required tech.

* waterwell icon, tile (hmmm, must be redrawn by someone competent :-)

* info with query tool seems to not work on desert and trees, or work randomly

* bug of trunk = (re)initialisation of engine and UI is not enough. (max tech level...)

* cursor is still blue even when we try to build a waterwell on 4 desert tiles. It Should become red
