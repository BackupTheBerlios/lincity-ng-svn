About automake/autoconf
-----------------------

You need to use automake 1.4 and autoconf version 2.13, with the gettext
extensions installed.  I am using gettext 0.10.38.


How to make an intermediate version
-----------------------------------

  1)     Run config.sh on focus.eecs (required for gettext macros)
  2)     make dist
  3)     Done!
