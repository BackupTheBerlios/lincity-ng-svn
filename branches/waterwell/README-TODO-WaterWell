README:
-------
Attempt to implement some kind of water management.
This file is a temporary note book.

HELP NEEDED:
------------
- Better graphic for icon and tile. (i did my best but its not enough ;-)

WIP:
----
1170: basic water management implemented:
 -icon, tile (hmmm, must be redrawn by someone competent)
 -help (en), info with query tool and in residences.
 -residence need water like food. Lack of water has the same consequences as lack of food.
 -random village has a water well.
1174:
 -not-so-random terrain depending on distance to water (instead of uniform empty green land.)

TODO: 
-----
* show well's range in starvation window (<= market range)
* load/save numof_waterwell and display it in stat window. (current load/save works)
* sound.
* basic ecology : desert, green, tree, tree2, tree3, % depending on water proximity.


AIM:
----
* simple ecology = periodic event :
   - neighbours  => % decrease/increase from desert to tree3. (tree3 need 4 neighbouring trees)
   - pollution ++%decrease
   - water ++%increase
   = just look nicer (change nothing in the game) but could show impact of human activities on forests :)

* farms, industries also need water (connection needed?, or pipes?)

* Water quality (from drinkable to mortal).
  - residences, farms and industries can pollute water.
  - park along a river or around a well will also reduce the pollution.
  - pollution transported by river will follow the flow, so travel toward the bottom
      of the map (y++) (roughtly opposite of wind direction :-)

* think of how to import existing games without killing all population by thirstyness.
  (maybe just add a new version to check at load time if water management should be enabled)

Won't do soon:
--------------
* Areas without water could need high-tech deep well and/or pipes to feed the water station.

* transport capacity for water = water_on_road, water_on rail.... ?
  This mean quantity management of water. can be very tricky in addition to quality.
  rev 1170 uses range, so no need for transport.
  ? market can buy/sell water ? or waterwell is a watermarket ? 

* fire/health cover in dry area should cost more (need more equipment ...)

REMARKS/NOTES:
--------------
Don't consider this is important, it's just some ideas i have while wandering in the
code. I write them here instead of somewhere else, but maybe i will just forget them later,
or put them in the wiki.

* random village is placed near water in original lincity :) 
  (see src/lincity/simulate.cpp random_start near line 610)

* Code contains obsolete stuff from old lincity (eg .csi references ...). Maybe a clean up should
 be considered, but that can be a big job with compatibility issues.
 (so in another branch, and later as far as i m concerned :-)

* better separation of engine and graphics could be nice for future:
   - a building gives: tech at build time, average state (production %) during last period
   - the drawing modules uses the info to choose correct tile, and manage looping for
     cleaner animation (currently fast speed skip frames => weird animation).

* With market range, everything can already jump accross rivers.
* rivers are ready for transport: in lin-city.h  
  #define MAX_FOOD_ON_RIVER (MAX_FOOD_ON_TRACK*2)
  #define MAX_JOBS_ON_RIVER (MAX_JOBS_ON_TRACK*2)
  #define MAX_COAL_ON_RIVER (MAX_COAL_ON_TRACK*2)
  #define MAX_GOODS_ON_RIVER (MAX_GOODS_ON_TRACK*2)
  #define MAX_ORE_ON_RIVER (MAX_ORE_ON_TRACK*2)
  #define MAX_STEEL_ON_RIVER (MAX_STEEL_ON_TRACK*2)

  but are not in GROUP_IS_TRANSPORT.
  #define GROUP_IS_TRANSPORT(group) \
            ((group == GROUP_TRACK) || \
             (group == GROUP_ROAD) || \
             (group == GROUP_RAIL) || \
             (group == GROUP_POWER_LINE))
  Beach scenario could cause trouble (stock many thing in the sea !).

* Parks are not entertainment parks. They are biological depollution tool
 => they are build in very polluted areas (sometimes mortal)
 => no child games should appear there!

* Parks appear too early, when they are not needed.

* Graphic before rail techlevel should not have cars, but horses and bullocks instead.
* Low tech houses looks too modern.

* non-navigable waters (not seas) could very slowly become green (less than 1/1000 chance per year)
