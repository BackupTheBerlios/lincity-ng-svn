Attempt to implement some kind of water management

TODO: 
-----
- transport capacity for water
- show well's range in starvation window (<= market range)
- add water management for residence (like food)
- add water well to random village

- think of how to import existing games without killing all population by thirstyness.
  (maybe just add a new version to check at load time if water management should be enabled)

AIM:
----
* Water availability can be computed from the initial map, from shortest distance
    to navigable water. Area without water should be yellow-brown like desert.
    Areas without water would need high-tech deep well and/or pipes to feed the water station.
* Water quality (from drinkable to mortal). 
* farms, industries also need water (connection needed?, or pipes?), and can pollute it
* park along a river or around a well will also reduce the pollution.
* pollution transported by river will follow the flow, so travel toward the bottom
    of the map (roughtly oposite of win direction :-) 

REMARKS:
--------
* Code contains obsolete stuff from old lincity (eg .csi references ...). Maybe a clean up should
 be considered, but that can be a big job with compatibility issues.
 (so in another branch, and later as far as i m concerned :-)
