    upgradeTransport="yes" means you can build transports
    (tracks, roads, railroad) over each other without
    bulldozing first. 
    instantBulldoze="yes" while pressing left mousbutton in bulldoze-
    mode almost everything under the cursur is blown up at once, so 
    be careful.
    showDay="yes" displays day, month and year in the statusbar
    instead of just month and year.

<!-- The values monthgraphW and monthgraphH influence the Size
    of the Economy-Graphs. If you are not a developer just stick to 
    the defaults.
    skipMonthsFast determines how many Months are skipped in
    fastest mode until the MainScreen is updated again. The
    default of 1 seems to be a good choice.
