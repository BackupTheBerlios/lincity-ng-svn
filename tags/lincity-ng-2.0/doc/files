	cliglobs.h - must stay here, as there are many global variables and some dependencies on X11/SVGA,etc.
	common.h - dispatcher for 
engine:
	simulation.cc - deleted dependencies on X11/Win32
	lintypes.cc - here are dependencies on readpng.h and the graphics files (icons) - should be moved to oldgui - then readpng.h could be moved there, too
